# 10mansCS
A 10mans bot coded for CS in C#. It is still a work in progress and is not able to run succesfully yet. The bot was first coded in python, but since Discord.NET has better support for Components and Interactions the bot is being rewritten in C#.

10mansCS is a bot that allows you to make CS:GO 5v5's matches with people in a discord server. When enough players entered the queue (A discord voice channel) the matchmaking begins. If every player has pressed a ready button, two leaders are chosen who choose their own team and the map. Matches are hosted using the Dathost service. This service allows pay/hour and can setup 5v5 matches automatially using a RestAPI
